![](/assets/images/new-toys-imac-and-sonos/imac.jpg) A couple of early
Christmas presents for the new house. A new iMac for the kitchen nook
and a [Sonos](http://www.sonos.com) system. I guess I haven't bought ram
in a while because it was under $100 to upgrade the iMac to [4G with ram
from OWC](http://eshop.macsales.com/shop/memory/iMac_Core_2_Duo/DDR2/).
The iMac is a perfect fit for the kitchen. The black and aluminum
matches the counters and appliances in the kitchen nicely.
I had been eyeing a Mac Mini for ages, but Apple doesn't seem very
interested in the Mini and for the price the iMac seemed like a much
better deal. Bought it from Amazon and it didn't come with Leopard but
Apple has an [update program](http://www.apple.com/macosx/uptodate/) so
the upgrade is mostly free. They want $10 for shipping me the CD. I
already have another copy, so it would be nice if they would just give
me a serial number.

As nice as the iMac is, the Sonos system is more interesting. I have had
various mechanisms for playing music from computers to decent speakers
over the years, but they were all inconvenient hacks. I don't want to
have to use a computer to control the music, and I definitely don't want
to do it via a clunky TV-based interface either. The Sonos with its
controller does a great job of taking the hack out of the system. It is
basically a wireless meshing modular music system. You put either an
amplified box with speakers connected, or an unamplified box connected
to an existing stereo in each room and the single controller can then
control each zone individually or you can link them all up so all the
zones play the same music. Each box also has a Line-In that can be used
as a source and played in any other zone

I wanted the iMac to be able to go to sleep without killing the music,
so I used a [250G Simpleshare](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16822154318)
drive I had sitting around. One of these days I need to figure out a
real NAS system for the house, but for now 250G is plenty as a Sonos
media source. I pointed iTunes at the Simpleshare and copied all the
music to the drive, then I pointed the Sonos system at the drive as well
and it worked nicely.

Internet radio streaming, Rhapsody and Pandora are all working very
nicely. I realize this turned out to be a bit of a boring post since
there were no technical hurdles and thus no interesting hacks involved
in getting any of this working. But that is afterall why people buy
things like iMacs and Sonos systems. If they didn't just work without
days of fiddling there are plenty of cheaper options that will let you
hack and fiddle for months and in the end you get something that almost
sorta mostly works.
