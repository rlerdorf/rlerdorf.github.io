I have this Dell LCD and I highly recommend it. It's rather bulky and
not nearly as slick looking as many others, but the image quality is
great. Wait for a Dell Small Business sale and you can pick it up for
$750-$850. Make sure you get a DVI-capable graphics card to go with it.
I found DVI quality quite a bit better than analog. Review: [Cadalyst
