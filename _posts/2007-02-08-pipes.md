http://pipes.yahoo.com is a cool toy, and by toy I mean it in the useful
and cant-stop-playing-with-it sense. My first impression when I saw an
early version a couple of months ago was, "How the heck did they do
that?" I was reading the Javascript source code for quite a while. Once
you get beyond the fact that this is a browser-based app doing this
without Flash, or Java or any similar cheats, you get down to what the
app actually does.  
  
Years ago I wrote this silly little Mashup example:  
  
<http://buzz.progphp.com/?q=4>  
  
It grabs an RSS feed, in this case the top daily search term % movers
from http://buzz.yahoo.com/feeds/buzzoverm.xml which gives you an
indication of what is on the minds of web searchers right now. I took
these searches and did a Yahoo Image search and a News search and
combined them in that oval interface you see. I had to do a bit of RSS
and XML parsing to take these different data sources and combine them.
This is what Pipes is all about. It provides a visual environment for
manipulating data sources and then provides a number of different ways
to get the results and integrate them into other things. Directly in
your RSS reader is probably the simplest, but you could also feed it to
PHP and do further data manipulation.  
  
A simplified Pipes version of the above takes the same Buzz.yahoo.com
RSS feed and does a Flickr search on each search term. The result looks
like this:  
  
<http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/DnudMlO32xGDcIu7pRr_og>  
  
The point here is not the visual output. It is meant to be fed to
something else. Hover over the "Subscribe" link on the right there. Then
click on the "How this pipe was made" image on the left to see how it
works.  
  
This is a particularly lame and simple pipe. Some much cooler ones
include:  
  
[Blog Buzz for Pipes](http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/CFSzjD232xGqEeCTZFUMqA/) combines a
couple of different blog watching feeds, filters out duplicates and
gives you a combined feed in reverse chronological order. When you look
at how it was made it becomes immediately obvious what it does. You can
save a copy and make your own version that watches for whatever terms
you want.  
  
Another interesting one takes the New York Times front page, runs a
content analysis on it to get a set of representative keywords and then
does a Flickr search on each of those.
<http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/vvW1cD212xGMiR9aqu5lkA/>.  
  
Here is a much more complex pipe that takes some user input. It finds
apartments near things. In [this case](http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/1mrlkB232xGjJDdwXqIxGw/?what=parks&mindist=2&location=palo+alto%2C+ca&_run=1&=Run+Pipe)
it looks for apartments within 2 miles of a Park in Palo Alto,
California by searching Craigslist, then doing a location extraction and
then doing a Yahoo\! Local Search for that location.  
  
Even if you have no use for processing data sources this way, open up
one of these Pipes and drag the boxes around and watch the pipes react.
Web apps don't get any cooler than this right now.
