I've given up on the idea of a PCI 802.11g card for the Linux server.
Driver issues are too annoying and an 802.11g bridge isn't much more
expensive anyway. So now the problem becomes finding a good bridge. The
[Netgear
WGE 101](http://www.netgear.com/products/prod_details.asp?prodID=209)
seems like it might do the trick. At around $95 it is also one of the
cheaper
ones.

The WET54G is the Linksys bridge. Reviews are not very flattering and it
is more
expensive.

The WGA54G is the Linksys game adapter which doesn't have anything to do
with games, of course. It just means it is a single-port bridge and it
is a bit cheaper than the WET54G. But unless it was much cheaper than
the Netgear I think I'd still prefer the
Netgear.

Another option would be to pick up another WRT54G since it can be hacked
into acting as a bridge if you turn on WDS
support.

And finally there is the D-Link DWL-G810. I have not had good luck with
D-Link gear in the past and it also looks rather ugly. Anybody out there
have one of these?
