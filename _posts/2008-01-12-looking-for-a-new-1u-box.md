title: Looking for a new 1U box

This server is well over 5 years old and really starting to show its
age. It's a 2.66GHz P4 with a Gig of ram and mirrored 80G drives. I am
constantly running out of disk space and spamd chews up all available
cpu on a regular basis. Moving Bayes token expiration to a cron job
helped spamd cpu usage a little bit, but it still isn't a happy
server.  
I need way more disk and way more ram. I'm looking for a dual-cpu,
mirrored (software raid this time) 500G drives, and 4G of ram 1U box to
stick in the colo. This

fits the bill, although I find the quad-core cpus a bit silly. I'd be
fine with quick dual-core chips, but the bang-for-the-buck on the
configs there seem to favour the 4-core chips.

looks ok as well.  
  
A Sun X2200 is a possibility, but they seem a bit pricy for what you get
and I like the new 45nm Intel chips.  
  
Has anybody run across any interesting new 1U servers?
