title: Linksys WRT54G Router
---


[![](/assets/images/linksys-wrt54g-router/wrt54g.Thumb.jpg)](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00007KDVI/lerdorf-20)This
is my current wireless router. Not because I love all things Linksys,
because really I don't, but because this is a neat little 125 MHz MIPS
box running Linux. And because of an oversight by Linksys in the Ping
tool on their Admin page it is easily hacked. You can do things like
running [Snort](http://www.snort.org) directly on it and have your
gateway email you or notify you via irc/IM/pager if someone is trying to
sniff your network. You can of course also run fancy
[netfilter/iptables](http://netfilter.org) rules or anything else you
can typically do on a Linux box when you have it acting as your gateway.
See the [SeattleWireless page on the
wrt54g](http://www.seattlewireless.net/index.cgi/LinksysWrt54g) for all
the details.
