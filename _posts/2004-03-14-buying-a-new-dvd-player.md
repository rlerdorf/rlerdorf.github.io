title: Buying a new DVD player

managed to break our old Sony DVD player which of course meant I got to
buy a new toy. I was very tempted by the [Gateway Networked DVD
Player](http://accessories.gateway.com/AccessoryStore/Consumer+Electronics_381930/Digital+TV_381941/DVD+Players_9000002/1530869_ProdDetail?tpcid=1000&productid=1530869)
and the new [LiteOn
LVD-2010](http://www.liteonamericas.com/press/LVD2010/020604.htm) which
is also a networked player. Being able to stream things to the player
skipping the middle step of having to burn to DVD first is attractive,
and of course, why would you buy any powered device without a NIC? Every
device should have an IP, no matter how inappropriate. However, I played
a bit with the Gateway player and the menus seemed clunky and the number
of formats it could play natively was limited. If the machine you are
streaming from has enough juice you can transcode from a large number of
formats on the fly, but for some reason I still wasn't sold on it. And
the LiteOn doesn't seem readily available yet. I couldn't find it
anywhere. So instead I picked up a Philips DVD727 for $79 from Fry's.  
  
It is a slick little progressive scan player (not that I have a TV
capable of that yet) with S-Video, component and optical outputs on the
back. The menus are simple and making it region-free was trivial. Open
tray, 9 9 9 9 0 (slowly), close tray. I tested it with a Danish region 2
PAL DVD and it played perfectly. Unlike many other players you can make
region-free, this one you can set to any region, so if you have any
region-locked dvds that won't play in region 0 you can set it explicitly
to the appropriate region.  
  
The next test was to see how well it handled a DVD+R data disc. I
grabbed some 3500 photos of Carl, 30 videos of various AVI, WMV and MPEG
formats and a couple of hundred mp3s and stuck them in Photos/, Videos/
and Music/ directories on a regular data dvd and popped it into the
player. It came up with a nice little directory of what was on the DVD.
It was only able to show the first 650 jpegs in my Photos directory. The
manual says there is a limit of 500 files per directory. So it looks
like I will have to spread my 3500 pictures out over many
sub-directories. Annoying, but not a big deal. The mp3 playback is nice.
It has playlists and even a shuffle mode. You can also start the mp3s
playing and switch over to the jpeg slideshow and have them both going
at the same time. For the videos it was only able to play the mpeg
files. No AVI nor WMV support apparently. But it still leaves our
previous Sony player in the dust by not needing to do full DVD authoring
which takes forever. Being able to browse your backup DVDs in your DVD
player is very nice. This player also supports SVCD and regular CD-R of
course.
