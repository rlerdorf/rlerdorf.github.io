This site is where I'll be jotting down notes, thoughts, and occasional longer pieces about
software, programming languages, and whatever else catches my attention.

Posts here are written in either GitHub-flavored Markdown or plain HTML — whichever feels
right for the content.

## Why a static site?

Static sites are fast, simple, and easy to maintain. There are no databases to worry about,
no server-side code to secure, and the whole thing lives in a git repository. If something
breaks, `git log` tells the story.

## What to expect

Expect irregular updates. Topics will range from PHP and C to systems programming, web
standards, and the occasional opinion on the state of the industry.

Stay tuned.
