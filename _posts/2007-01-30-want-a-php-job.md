title: Want a PHP job?
---


Want to work on some of the busiest and coolest web apps in the world?  
  
Do you like Flickr, and want to work downtown San Francisco?  
  
Or perhaps you are into music, movies or TV and want to work out of
Santa Monica? Jumpcut? Or have you seen answers.yahoo.com? Address Book,
Personals, Search, Premium Services, Hot Jobs? Want to do interesting
things combining PHP and Flash?  
  
Yes, I get a referral bonus, but I need more toys. You get a cool job
though, so I think we are even.  
  
Send me your resume and let me know what sort of stuff you are
interested in or poke around on <http://careers.yahoo.com/> and let me
know which job interests you and I will forward your resume to the
appropriate hiring manager.
