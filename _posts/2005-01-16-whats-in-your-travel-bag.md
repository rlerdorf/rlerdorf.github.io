I travel quite a bit and a couple of people have asked me what I bring
along. So here it is. I emptied my computer knapsack onto the table at
the Vancouver hotel I am in after yet another conference. Roughly from
left to right:

  - Spare wireless cards - Rarely used, but sometimes it is handy to
    have two wireless nics in the laptop to bounce a signal along or to
    lend cards to people.
  - Charger for the Canon S400 travel camera (camera is taking the
    picture, of course)
  - S-Video cable and 8mm to audio left/right cable used for connecting
    the laptop to the hotel TV so I can watch movies on a screen bigger
    than my laptop screen.
  - USB cable for offloading the camera and also for connecting the
    flash mp3 player
  - Case for the camera
  - Toiletries![](/assets/images/whats-in-your-travel-bag/IMG_7549.JPG)
  - Targus Air travel power supply
  - Lightweight extension cord
  - USB memory stick which doubles as a pen
  - RSA Key to connect to the work network
  - 2-foot omni-directional wifi antenna
  - WRT54G + power supply
  - Spare AAA battery needed for both mp3 player and noise-cancelling
    headphones
  - Watch
  - DVI-VGA Adapter cable (critical for presentations)
  - Credit cards and ATM card
  - Passport (preferably from a non-war mongering nation)
  - Laptop + power supply
  - Network cable
  - USB Mouse (because trackpads suck)
  - mp3 player
  - Noise cancelling headphones

Nothing really out of the ordinary here except perhaps the rather large
antenna. Also, make sure all your power supplies are 110-240 safe and
avoid any surge-protection powerbars (they are too big anyway) since
that stuff tends to blow up when you plug them into a 220V outlet.
