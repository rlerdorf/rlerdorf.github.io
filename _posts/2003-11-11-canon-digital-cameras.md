Finally a digital SLR we can afford. Called the Digital Rebel in the US
and EOS 300D elsewhere. They left out a few things, but still a very
impressive camera.

The S400 is still the coolest small 4MP digital camera around and a
perfect sidekick to the Digital Rebel. We use it as our travel camera to
go with the G3. The G3 with the external flash attached and with its
better lens still takes noticably better pictures though.

Although the newer SD-memory SD100 is cool as well.

And an even newer SD-based camera. The SD10 loses the optical viewfinder
and the optical zoom, but it is really really small and comes in 4
colours. [DCResource Review](http://www.dcresource.com/reviews/canon/powershot_sd10-review/index.shtml)

This is our current digital camera. Aside from being a bit bulky, it is
a great camera. [DPReview](http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/canong3/)
