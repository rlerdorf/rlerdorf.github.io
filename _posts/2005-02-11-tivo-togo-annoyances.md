title: TiVo ToGo Annoyances
---


![](/assets/images/tivo-togo-annoyances/tivo_logo.jpg) I put in my request
weeks ago to get onto the priority list to get the new TivoToGo-enabled
software on my Tivos. It finally arrived a couple of days ago. I wanted
to write something up on it as soon as possible, but unfortunately it
has taken me 3 days to get anywhere with it, and I still don't have a
DVD with my shows on it. There were a number of problems.  
The Tivo needed a reboot before it would work and since it was in the
middle of recording something I didn't want to reboot it. That meant I
couldn't do it the first night.  
  
After a reboot the Tivo Desktop software was able to connect to my Tivo.
Unfortunately it takes close to an infinite amount of time to transfer
stuff. I have 7 episodes of "24" recorded at best quality I want to put
on a DVD. That translates to about 15G of data I needed to transfer. I
have a USB wired adapter plugged into a WRT54G and then an 802.11g
connection to another WRT54G sitting next to a Windows box. This
combination got me a transfer rate of about 1G/hour which means
transferring my 7 episodes took over 15 hours.  
  
Ok, a day later all the episodes came across. I grabbed the trial copy
of Sonic MyDVD Studio 6.1 which is what Tivo suggests we use to create
our dvds. I had configured my TiVo Desktop to stick my shows on E:\\tivo
since I didn't have room on my C drive. Unfortunately there is no
provision in MyDVD to change the directory it looks for tv shows in. You
can browse to the files and add them manually, but then you don't get
the same ui screen that shows which shows are available. A quick
register hack fixed that, but you can't expect Joe User to hack his
registry for something this simple.  
  
The MyDVD UI for adding shows is horrible. It doesn't show the episode
information at all, so I had my list of 7 episodes all titled "24" with
no clue as to which was which. So you are probably better off browsing
to them and adding them manually than using the button designed for
this.  
  
MyDVD has absolutely no TiVo integration. I am sure that I read at some
point that the dvds you create would have a Tivo-like navigation menu.
No such thing exists in MyDVD. There isn't even a TiVo theme for the top
DVD menu. They could at least have added a JPG with a TiVo logo or
something. Nothing.  
  
When I finally did start the burn process MyDVD told me it was building
the menus. I had read it was slow, so I went to bed. 7 hours later it
was still building the menus. So I left it another 12 hours. No
progress. The thing isn't hung. There is a cancel button that works fine
and asks me if I am sure I want to cancel since cancelling could take a
"long" time\!  
  
So as far as I can tell burning a DVD simply isn't working for me. Who
knows what the problem may be. Conflict with something else that is
installed perhaps? This is Windows, you can never really be sure why
something doesn't work. Unfortunately the OSX TiVo Desktop 2.0 is not
availalble yet so I can't do this on my Powerbook yet. At this point it
looks like my only real option is to work around MyDVD and use something
like [this hack](http://www.evillabs.net/tivo/) to convert the .tivo
files to mpeg2. In the long run that's probably much more useful anyway.
The .tivo files have a playback password on them you have to remember
which seems to me to be DRM run amok. Not that I have a VCR, but if I
did, it wouldn't have a password option. This is no different.  
  
Another annoying thing is that the recorded shows have a thin strip of
white on black noise at the top. Looks to be too organized to be noise
actually. Closed captioning data or something? Guess I may need to edit
the stream to cut that out and also to snip out the commercials so I can
fit more on a dvd.  
  
I'll update this if I ever get my shows onto a dvd that works. At this
point I am having a hard time disagreeing with the [TiVo
Deathwatch](http://www.engadget.com/entry/1234000100030115). I'll
probably be looking for an alternative soon.  
  
**Update:** Ok, I finally managed to burn a working DVD from the MyDVD
software. After a ctrl-alt-del to kill off the running process that had
been going for almost 24 hours, I restarted it, reloaded the project and
it actually worked. Still took a couple of hours to sit and chew on the
2 .tivo files I had fed it, but the final DVD works. It still has the
noise at the top which is distracting, but the quality is ok. So all in
all, out of the 8 hours of "24" which was supposed to be my test case,
eliminating the hung MyDVD and other delays and extrapolating from the 3
hours I have managed to burn so far, it will end up taking somewhere
between 20 and 24 hours to create the 3 DVDs assuming I am right there
at each user-interaction point ready to click or switch dvds and
assuming no hung processes or crashes. I think the upper range my
patience will tolerate is 8 hours to burn 8 hours of content. For it to
be something I would use often it would need to be at least 3x or 4x, as
in 15-20 minutes for every hour of content.  
  
By the way, don't get me wrong, I love my TiVo. I have played a little
bit with alternatives, and for the core functionality of scheduling and
recording shows nothing I have seen beats it. But the alternatives are
catching up and my expectations are high.
