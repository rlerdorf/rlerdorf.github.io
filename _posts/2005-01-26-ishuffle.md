A 1G iShuffle showed up today. Carl instantly took to it and at one
point declared, "I like it." So if nothing else, Apple has managed to
design something that appeals to a 2-year old.  
  
Much has been written about the lack of a screen on this thing and how
it is just a USB memory stick with an earphone plug. While that is
pretty much true, it is also priced in the ballpark of dumb memory
sticks so I am not sure why people complain so much about that. My main
use for an mp3 player is during my runs. I tend to run without my
glasses so looking at any sort of display while running is out of the
question. I have enough trouble picking out cars without my glasses,
never mind a tiny lcd display. When I am stationary I turn to my
surgically attached laptop which is a perfectly good mp3 player by
itself, but running with a laptop with its hard drive spinning would be
insane and as far as I am concerned the same applies to running with a
hard drive based player. I have already destroyed one HD player by doing
that.  
  
We have two other flash players in the household, both of them with
screens, and I **never** look at them. Flash players are not designed to
hold your entire music collection. You have that somewhere else and you
just load up stuff you want to listen to for a certain activity. Our
other flash players have been stuck in random-play mode for years so it
was as if Apple designed a player that catered specifically to the way I
use
them.

Christine has an iRiver which is a great flash player. But they are a
tad pricy, and we already have one of those. No fun buying 2 of the same
toys. I also have a rather crappy RAVE-MP AMP-256 flash player I picked
up from Walmart for under $50 a while back. It does its job, sort of,
but the single AAA battery vs. the AA in the iRiver is annoying, and
often it won't start unless I pull the battery and re-insert it. Some
sort of firmware bug that they have been promising a fix for. The volume
is too low on it and the whole thing feels flimsy, so I am not a huge
fan. Then again, for under $50 it's not a bad deal and if they ever come
out with that firmware update that fixes the boot and voume problems,
and also allowing you to put more than a 512M add-on SD card in it, then
it would be a steal at that price. For now I only see myself using it
for its radio and voice recording if I can't steal Christine's iRiver
which is better at both.  
  
Anyway, back to the iShuffle. There really isn't that much to say about
it. You plug it in, iTunes launches automatically (on both OSX and XP)
and you either randomly autofill it or you drag songs onto it. Or you do
a combination. The volume is good. It weighs nothing. The controls rival
the iRiver stick and are easy to operate with one hand unlike the AMP256
which is impossible to control both tracks and voume with one hand
unless you have a triple-jointed thumb. One thing that did annoy me was
the fact that it doesn't want to connect to 2 different iTunes. I loaded
it up on my Powerbook and then plugged it into an XP box to put a few
songs on it that was only on that machine and it asked me if I wanted to
tie it to this iTunes instead. I understand why this is so from a legal
perspective, but given how trivial this restriction is to work around it
is one of those things that is just irritating. Also, when I said no it
simply wasn't visible, and it isn't showing up as a regular USB mass
storage device after that either. If you don't launch iTunes it appears
nicely as a usb mass storage device and you can use it like a regular
memory stick. I also really like the built-in USB plug and the fact that
it recharges through it. The other two flash players in the household
can easily go 6 months between music updates because it is a hassle to
find the usb cable and hook it up. With the iShuffle recharging and
updating the music on it is a single seamless operation. And with
Autofill it is just a single click. The other unique feature I haven't
seen mentioned much is the option in iTunes to automatically convert to
128kbps AAC for anything you transfer to it to squeeze more tracks onto
it.  
  
Perhaps related to that automatic down-conversion feature, it seems like
there may be a bug in iTunes. For example right now it is reporting
this:

So which is it? Have I used 984M or 782M? I assume there isn't 200M of
overhead hiding in there. I get an out-of-space error when trying to add
more tracks at this point, yet they still seem to show up and the 782
number goes up while the 984 stays the same. Unplugging it and
restarting iTunes doesn't change anything. I did have a number of large
.WAV files that I put on there and then converted them to 128kbps AAC
once they were already on there. iTunes is telling me they were
converted, but it seems like the fact that the file sizes changed on
files already on the player isn't being taken into account somewhere.  
  
My final verdict is that this is a cool cheap little player for people
like me who can't justify paying $400 for an mp3 player. The iPod mini
is definitely an option here for more features and storage, but there is
still a hard drive which won't be happy with my vigorous stomping when I
run and up in that pricerange there are other options with built-in
radios that seem just as appealing. Since I already have two flash
players with radios and the ability to record, I didn't really care
about these features, but if you aren't a gadget-collecting geek and
just want one and don't mind spending a little bit more I would suggest
one of the iRiver flash players. Of course you don't get native iTunes
integration with a non-iPod which might be a consideration. All in all I
am using the shuffle for my runs now in place of the AMP256 because of
its higher capacity and seamless charging/updating and because Christine
has claimed the iRiver and won't let me steal it.
