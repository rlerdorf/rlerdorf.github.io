Another Linksys gadget. A motion-sensitive wireless video camera that
can alert you via email when it sees motion and it streams out 320x240
video. Could use it to bring CarlCam back, although my outbound
bandwidth on this Comcast cable connection isn't really sufficient for
it. I have been eyeing the networked cameras like the Axis 2100 (on the
right) for quite a while, but they always seemed too pricy. This Linksys
is $100 cheaper than the Axis and it is wireless.
