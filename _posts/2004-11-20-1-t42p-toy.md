A negative toy posting...  
  
My nice new T42p was stolen by some loser at a PHP conference in Paris.
It is amazingly inconvenient to lose a laptop like this. It was from
inside the conference hall and there was virtually no non-geek traffic
there. If a fellow geek actually stole my laptop from a PHP conference
then there is something seriously wrong with the world. You can steal my
car, my money, my shoes, I don't really care, but don't steal my damn
laptop\!  
  
Now to determine what to replace it with. It took a while to get it
configured nicely and I really don't have the time nor the energy to do
that again. Perhaps a G4 Powerbook so I don't have to fiddle as much.
Will be hard to give up that nice 1600x1200 Flexview display though.
