title: 100 Runs
---


My [previous entry](http://toys.lerdorf.com/archives/42-Nike+iPod-Goodness.html) way
back on Aug.18 talked about the Nike+ipod widget I had picked up along
with a first gen Nano. I figure it is time for an update. I still use it
5 or 6 times a week and I just logged my 100th run. There have been a
few more actually, but I have had the odd Nano crash/corruption on me
before I had a chance to upload a run.  
Despite those occasional technical glitches, I still really like using
it. I have been eyeing the [Garmin Forerunner 305](http://www.garmin.com/products/forerunner305/), but I
actually like listening to music or a podcast as I run and it seems a
bit much to strap a GPS to my wrist and also carry an mp3 player. Plus
the thing costs $300+ vs. the $27 the Nike+ipod gadget costs, assuming
you already have a Nano.  
  
My 100th run looked like this:

620 miles later and some 80,000 calories burned I have gone from being a
205lb fat slow geek to a 175lb slow geek. Not entirely true, I lost
about 10lb before I started running more seriously, so the Aug.18 to
Jan.27 timeframe was about a 20lb drop. 80,000 calories and I read that
one pound is about 3500 calories which seems to fit my numbers.  
  
I ran a couple of hundred miles in a pair of Nike+ shoes. It is very
convenient to have the sensor right in the sole of the shoe, but that is
the only thing I liked about those shoes. Now I have a pair of New
Balance 767's and have sewn the little sensor seated in a [Switcheasy
RunAway](http://switcheasy.com) thing to the front of the shoe with the
back looped through the bottom of the laces. That gets it as horizontal
as possible and I find it is more accurate that way. Of course the
RunAway plastic thing needs a bit of tape to make sure it doesn't swing
or pop open. Here is a picture of the hack job:

I have also been playing with the run data a bit. Each run is stored in
an XML file which is uploaded to the Nike site by itunes when you synch.
You can easily read the files yourself by mounting the ipod and
navigating to it. However, the red Nike interface you see above is a
flash thing and since flash is obviously client-side the site needs some
sort of API. With a little digging with Firebug it was trivial to figure
out how it worked and I whipped up a little
[Serendipity](http://s9y.org) plugin to show my stats. You can see it in
the right column of this page. And I wrote a simple PHP 5 class that
makes it rather easy to integrate this stuff into other apps. You can
see the code here:

Each run in the run list has an id and you can call the run() method in
that class to get the raw data for that run. Graphing that gives us
something like this for that same run I showed at the top:

The grey line is the raw data and the red line is a [Lowess
curve](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_regression) based on that. I
find it interesting how noisy the raw data actually is. Especially for
the shorter runs, but by applying a bit of local regression it cleans up
nicely and data that seems accurate emerges. I can pick out the uphill
stretches of my run from the graph above. If you click on the runs in
the right sidebar section there you can see the graphs of my other
runs.  
  
If I could somehow find some free time I'd love to build a better
tracking site than that Nike thing and then also have it support the
Forerunner and whatever other devices are out there. But for now most of
my free time is spent running. Probably better for me in the "long run"
anyway.
