<p>
  Complexity is easy. Simplicity is hard. This is true in code, in prose, and in most
  things worth doing well.
</p>

<p>
  Every abstraction you add is a bet that the problem it solves is more common than the
  confusion it introduces. Sometimes that bet pays off. Often it doesn't.
</p>

<h2>The cost of abstraction</h2>

<p>
  When I look at software systems that have aged well, they almost always share a trait:
  the abstractions are thin and the primitives are exposed. The layers exist to organize,
  not to hide.
</p>

<p>
  When I look at systems that became unmaintainable, the opposite is usually true. Someone
  built a framework on top of a framework on top of a framework, and now nobody can trace
  a request from the outside world to the line of code that handles it.
</p>

<h2>A useful heuristic</h2>

<p>
  Before adding an abstraction, ask: <em>can I explain what this does in one sentence?</em>
  If the answer requires more than one sentence, the abstraction may be doing too much —
  or it may not need to exist at all.
</p>
