If you look around a bit, you can find this Netgear MR814 wireless
gateway for next to nothing. $35 on Amazon right now, for example, but
often even cheaper. I bought one a while ago but didn't use it because
it was very buggy. However with the latest firmware it is actually
pretty good now. But, also consider that 802.11g gateways are getting
cheaper quickly, so I am not sure there is much point buying an 11b one
anymore. To upgrade it, make sure you clear your previous config
completely by holding the little reset button on the back for 10-15
seconds, then install this firmware:
