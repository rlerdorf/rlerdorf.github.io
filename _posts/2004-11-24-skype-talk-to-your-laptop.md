[Skype](http://www.skype.com) has been out for a couple of months now,
but I only recently had a look. I have never been very impressed with
the audio quality of these various voice-chat systems. However, Skype is
a whole different story. With similar-looking clients for Windows,
Linux, OSX and PocketPC, a mechanism called
[SkypeOut](http://www.skype.com/help/faq/skypeout.html) for making calls
to regular phones and some nifty P2P principles applied to the problem
of getting in and out from behind firewalls and NAT gateways all
combining to create something that works extremely well for most people.
The biggest problem people generally have with it is figuring out how to
get a microphone installed and configured for their systems.

  

I installed it on a machine at home before heading to Paris and have
been using it to talk to Christine from Paris. I also got my parents to
install it by themselves and have had 3-way conference calls with me in
Paris, my parents in Toronto and Christine in California. I have also
called landlines in the US from Paris and Christine called my hotel
landline in Paris using Skype. Overall the quality of all these calls
were amazing. Every now and then there would be a slight drop or when 2
or 3 people all spoke at once it would occasionally garble things, but
it is definitely the coolest piece of software I have used in a while.
Although I may have to invest in a headset for it. You get some strange
looks when you sit there talking to your laptop.
