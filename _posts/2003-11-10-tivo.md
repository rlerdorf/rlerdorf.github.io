asked me about getting a Tivo. Basically if you don't do DirecTV, a
series 1 Tivo is all you really need. I have had an original Phillips
14-hour series 1 Tivo for years. Stuck a 120G drive in it and a network
card and it is a happy little box. Should be in some sort of hall of
fame for the best geek gadgets of all time.
[ComputerGeeks](http://www.computergeeks.com/details.asp?invtid=TIVO80-R)
has the original Tivo already upgraded with an 80G drive for $219 which
isn't a bad price. And if you add the promotional code "**GEEKTIVO**"
during checkout, you get $20 off. $199 for a series 1 80G Tivo is not
bad. The original 14-hour Phillips Tivo can sometimes be had for $89
from [ServiceDVR](http://www.servicedvr.com/Extra/BuyExtraTivo.asp). But
right now they don't seem to have any of the 14-hour ones. The cheapest
is a 30-hour for $129. So, for the geeks out there, find yourself a
14-hour series 1 Tivo in good working order and [upgrade
it](http://www.newreleasesvideo.com/hinsdale-how-to/index9.html). Plenty
of people are upgrading to series 2 or DirecTivo boxes so you can also
[check Ebay](http://search.ebay.com/search/search.dll?query=tivo) and
look for an HDR-112 (original 14-hour Tivo) or better. For the
non-geeks, that $199 Tivo from ComputerGeeks is probably your best
option right now. Also have a look at [Seth's TiVo Evangelism
Page](http://www.sethb.com/TiVo/) for more Tivomania.
