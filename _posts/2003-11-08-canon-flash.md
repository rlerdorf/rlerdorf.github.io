A nice E-TTL compatible flash which works perfectly with our G3 and it
will work nicely with the Digital Rebel when/if we pick that up. It can
also act as a slave flash for the much more expensive 550EX. I find my
pictures are sharper and more alive when I am taking any sort of indoor
or otherwise low-light shots with this flash.
