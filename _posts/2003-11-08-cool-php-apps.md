title: Cool PHP Apps
---


People are always asking me which PHP applications I prefer. It is
obviously a very subjective thing, but here is a list of ones I have
worked with and liked: [![](/assets/images/cool-php-apps/fud.gif) FUDForum](http://fud.prohost.org)
is a very nice forum package written by Ilia.  
[![](/assets/images/cool-php-apps/gallery.jpg) Gallery](http://gallery.menalto.com/)
is the ultimate photo album application. You can see it in action at
[phpics.com](http://phpics.com)  
[![](/assets/images/cool-php-apps/s9y.gif) Serendipity](http://s9y.org/) is a cool blog package.
I really don't like blogs, but as you can see from this toy page which is using
Serendipity it doesn't have to be just for your standard boring and
useless blog. It can be used for a useless toy page too.
